        %p With new, surprisingly designed stands, the fair’s look and layout will bring out the best in the contemporary photography on offer. Unseen has hired renowned industrial and interior design agency Müller van Tol, which made its name with projects for cutting-edge nightspots as well as businesslike environments.

        %p Unseen is a fair with a festival flair. Additional on- site events will include a print fair, exhibitions, debates, film screenings and lively evening events.

Foam magazine’s Talent issue will be launched and exhibited on the Unseen fair site, the Westerpark cinema will play a special Unseen programme and documentary photography foundation Dutch Doc will add a documentary component to the versatile Unseen programme. other prominent parties, with whom we are currently in talks, have shown great interest in collaborating with Unseen for the fair’s side- programming.

        %p Amsterdam is Unseen’s home base. With its progressive galleries and renowned art academies, the city offers a fruitful foundation for the arts and thus is the ideal setting for Unseen. Amsterdam and Unseen share an international appeal, with a mentality that blends creativity, innovation and a mercantile spirit. The city stimulates an experimental atmosphere. here, conceptual thinking is second nature, it is a perfect place for the development of international creative talent. It is not without reason that nearly half the students at the city’s art institutes, like the Gerrit Rietveld Academie and the Rijksakademie, come from abroad.
