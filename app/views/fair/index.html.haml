    .row
      .col-md-6
        %p Unseen not only inspires the seasoned collector but also nurtures the passion of an entirely new audience. We encourage potential collectors to take their first steps in the collection of contemporary photography. Online courses and a new television series, co-produced with the Dutch broadcasting company AVRO, are part of this special programme to assist ‘first-time buyers.’
      .col-md-6
        %p Especially for these new collectors, we have developed the Unseen Collection, a selection of photographs for prices under €1,000.
