          A fair with a festival flair
        %p
          With new, surprisingly designed stands, the fair’s look and layout will bring out the best in the contemporary photography on offer. Unseen has hired renowned industrial and interior design agency Müller van Tol, which made its name with projects for cutting-edge nightspots as well as businesslike environments. For Unseen, Muller van Tol created a floorplan with an open feel. In the impressive hall of the gashouder, with its 60 meter diameter and 14 meter high ceilings, all the galleries are equally prominently present.

          The clear, open layout is welcoming to visitors. The pavilion at the centre of the construction, 4 meters above the floor, gives visitors access to a panoramic view of all the stands. The latest technology will provide optimal service to visitors and gallerists alike.

        Amsterdam is Unseen’s home base. With its progressive galleries and renowned art academies, the city offers a fruitful foundation for the arts and thus is the ideal setting for Unseen. Amsterdam and Unseen share an international appeal, with a mentality that blends creativity, innovation and a mercantile spirit. The city stimulates an experimental atmosphere. here, conceptual thinking is second nature, it is a perfect place for the development of international creative talent. It is not without reason that nearly half the students at the city’s art institutes, like the Gerrit Rietveld Academie and the Rijksakademie, come from abroad.
